                    <p>Ida B. Wells was born into slavery in 1862. A few months later, the emancipation proclamation freed her and her family. As a child, she was exposed to politics as both of her parents were politically active. Her father, James Wells was famously known as "race man" for his involvement in the republican party. In 1878, both of Ida Wells' parents died of yellow fever, leaving her to care for her siblings. She then took them to Memphis, where she began her career as an activist and journalist. </p>

                <p>In Memphis, Wells wrote under the pen name, "Iola". She became the editor and co-owner of the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight. In March of 1892, three friends of Wells were murdered by a mob of white men after their grocery store had become popular enough to divert business from a white competitor. There were no shortage of lynchings like these across the American South, and they were often met with no legal investigation.</br> </br>This event pushed Wells to launch an invesigation into lynching where she would go on to expose the lies that were used to justify this violence. Most white people had claimed that lynchings were the response to criminal acts commited by black people, but this wasn't the case. Wells was able to prove through her research that lynching was a way to control or punish black people who competed with whites. She also challenged the idea that black men were lynched to protect white women by pointing out the historical sexual violence commited upon black women by white men. She risked her life searching for answers, as looking into racially-motivated murders enraged white men who had killed her friends. While she was out of town, a group of white men burned her printing presses to the ground and threatened to kill her if she returned. This caused her to move to New York.</p>

                    <h1>Fight the YMCA's Segregationist Policies</h1>
                    <p>When Wells found out that the YMCA excluded black men, she organized the members of her Bible study group to create a space that would provide lodgeing, employment assistance, and social activities. Her efforts led to the overthrow of the YMCA's racist policies of exclusion. </p>

                    <h1>Found the NAACP</h1>
                    <p>In 1896, Wells attended a conference for an organization that would go on to become the National Associated for the Advancement of Colored People. However, Wells eventually cut ties with the oganization because she felt like it lacked action-based initiatives. The organaztion percieved her as too "radical" as she insisted on airing out all of the atrocities that were being commited in the South, while other leaders in the organization thought that doing so would be counter-productive in negotiations with white politicians.</p>

                    <h1>Marched on the White House</h1>
                    <p>On March 3rd, 1913, five thousand suffragists maarched up Pennsylvania Avenue. During this protest, Wells ignored the organizer's attempt to place black women at the back of the march. Instead, she  marched up front, alongside the white women. Many historians credit this parade for giving the suffrage movement a new wave of inspiration and purpose as it set a precedent encouraging future generations to stand up and fight.  </p>
